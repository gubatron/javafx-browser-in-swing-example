# Sample Swing App with an embedded JavaFX Web Browser component

This seems to be the easiest and free path if you need to embed a chrome browser in your java app.

The build.gradle file points to a fixed location on my macbook, might want to change that if you want to build.

## Gradle tasks

### Build
`./gradlew build`

### Run
`./gradlew run`

### Clean
`./gradlew clean`
